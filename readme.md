# Serious Business

## Instructions

https://github.com/becodeorg/GNT-Yu-1.10/blob/master/2.The-Hills/1.Javascript-Intro/1.DOM-Manipulation/3.Serious-Business.md

* Create a simple html page.
* Add some styling so it looks good.
* Add two columns:
    - One column has a table containing the business hours of a company (just pick some random business hours)
    - The second column has a simple paragraph, containing a phrase declaring the business currently open / closed.
* Bonus:
    - Add a live updating clock of the current time (digital).
    - Add a button "Close early".
    - When you click this button, the current day's business hours end at the current time in the table.

## Schedule

* Start date: April 3rd, 2019.
* End date: April 4th, 2019.

## Difficulties

Updating the schedule when clicking on the "close early" button. I created a condition for each day when it's possible to close early, but it's a lot of code.

## What I learned

* Building and using arrays (for days of the week and months).
* Learning about dates (date and time).
* Adding HTML in Javascript.

## Feedback about the exercise

This exercise was easier than the Nyan Cat and I wish it came first. I think it was more pedagogical for learning some Javascript basics than the Nyan Cat. It was also easier to find information on the internet.
